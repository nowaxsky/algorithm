# Q2 - Sorted Merge

Given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B.
Merge B into A in sorted order.

## example
Input:<br>
a[] = {10, 12, 13, 14, 18, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA}<br>
b[] = {16, 17, 19, 20, 22}<br>
<br>
Output:<br>
a[] = {10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22}

## Solution

```java
public void sortedMerge(int[] a, int[] b, int numA, int numB) {
  // Write your code here!
}
```
